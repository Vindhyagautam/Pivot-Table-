# Pivot-Table-
Have done on work using Excel's one of the best feature i.e. Pivot Table, with this I have merged my work by using the Power BI features i.e. Power Pivot.
First I got the excel data from the source and then I have uploaded the Excel data in the Excel and then have done work on the data using the Pivot Table, 
with this I have also linked my Power BI with my excel data so that I can use the Power Pivot option in the Power BI which is a very powerful tool in the Power BI.

Have also different features of Excel to make my data more readable and accountable.

Here's the glimpse of my work:
